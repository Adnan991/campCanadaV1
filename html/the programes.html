<h1>The Positions</h1>
<p id="text-1">There are three positions you can apply for at a Camp in Canada. They are general
camp counsellor, activities camp counsellor and support staff. While the counsellor
positions are the most popular and have you working closely with the children,
all positions need you to be highly energetic and outgoing. Theses positions
are great opportunities to boost your skills, add international work to your
CV and to immerse yourself in the Canadian culture.<p>

<h1>Camp Counsellor</h1>
<p id="text-2">As a leader, role model, friend, instructor, big brother or sister,
cheerleader and hero to campers of varying ages, your primary responsibility
is overall supervision. You’re there to ensure their well-being and safety,
and make their camp experience more fun and rewarding. There are two types
of counsellor roles; activities counsellor and general counsellor.
An activities counsellor will have their own station to teach/coach the children
a specified skill, while a general counsellor is more hands on with the children
and is more involved with their daily routine.</p>

<h1>ACCOMMODATION</h1>
<p id="text-3">Most counsellors will be living in a cabin or platform tent with a co-counsellor
and 8 to 12 campers of similar age. Sometimes cabins have their own bathroom,
but it is also common for several cabins to share a large centralized bath and shower facility.</p>

<h1>FOOD</h1>
<p id="text-4">Staff and campers eat in what is normally called the Dining Hall.
Depending on your camp, you get your food from a “buffet” or it is served “family style”
(in which platters of food are brought to your table). In most cases you will eat with your
campers and co-counsellors.  The dining hall is a fun and lively part of camp, often with
lots of talking, chants and singing.</p>
